# Exploratory data analysis using Uber Data set

## Introduction
The data set used is a masked data set similar to what data analysts at Uber handle. Solving this assignment will give you an idea of how problems are systematically solved using EDA and data visualization.

## Business Understanding
Customers often face issues like cancellation by drivers or non-availability of cars, which also impact Uber's business. This analysis aims to address the problem of driver cancellation and non-availability of cars leading to potential revenue loss.

## Business Objectives
The aim of the analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem and recommend ways to improve the situation. The analysis should present the root cause(s), possible hypotheses, and recommendations.

## Data Understanding
The dataset includes attributes such as request id, time of request, drop-off time, pick-up point, driver id, and status of the request. For this assignment, only trips to and from the airport are considered.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Identify data quality issues and clean the data for analysis. Ensure that dates and times are in the proper format and derive new variables for analysis.

## Results Expected
- Visually identify the most pressing problems for Uber.
- Find the gap between supply and demand using plots.
- Identify the most problematic types of requests and time slots using plots.
- Find the time slots when the highest gap exists.
- Find the types of requests for which the gap is the most severe in the identified time slots.
- Recommend ways to resolve the supply-demand gap.

## Submission Requirements
- Create plots to visualize the data and present the analysis in a well-formatted presentation (PDF version of the PPT).
- Include a commented Jupyter Notebook with the analysis done in Python, including all plots.
- You may recreate the plots in Tableau for inclusion in the presentation.
